# Resume Maciej Ba≈õcik - Frontend Developer

Hello! My name is Maciej Bascik, and I am a frontend developer with great ambitions. I would like to present my portfolio, which I created to showcase my skills, experience, and the projects I have worked on. This portfolio is my business card, aimed at attracting potential employers and collaborators. I am committed to continuous professional development and want to demonstrate how creative and dedicated I am in creating modern user interfaces.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: For building the structure and semantics of the website.
- **CSS3 (Sass) + Tailwind**: For styling the website, using the Sass preprocessor to better organize the code.
- **Next.js**: For creating server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **DaisyUI**: For styling components using Tailwind CSS.
- **Vercel**: For hosting and managing application deployments.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the source code and project management.

## Portfolio Features

- **Home Page**: An introduction to myself.
- **Projects**: Detailed descriptions of the projects I have worked on, with links to GitHub repositories and live versions of the applications.
- **Contact**: A contact form and links to my social media profiles.

## How I Implemented the Project

The project is hosted on Vercel, allowing for quick and easy deployments and scaling of the application. By using Next.js, I was able to create an efficient application with server-side rendering, which improves SEO and page load times. DaisyUI, built on top of Tailwind CSS, enabled me to style components quickly and effectively.

## Contact

Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you have any questions or if you would like to collaborate!



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
